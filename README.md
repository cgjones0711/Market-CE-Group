## Name: Ambience Market Watch and Currency Exchange
Description: Ambience Market Watch and Currency Exchange is an application that combines different types of market data to allow users to make educated decisions on their future investments to their portfolios. With an ever-changing world where the dollar is becoming less used for international trading; we have also designed into the feature a currency exchange list for the most traded world currencies. Also, for the userâ€™s convenience our team has introduced a currency exchange calculator to make conversions even easier. At the bottom of the application we have also included different commodities exchange pricing so that the user has a one stop shop to differing market portfolio options.
